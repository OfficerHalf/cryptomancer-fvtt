After the cantrip has been cast on the piece of art, it can be cast again any time the caster wishes to mentally conjure a snapshot still of what the art piece can currently see. The cantrip lasts until the caster revokes it, dies, or turns a new piece of art into a scrying device. This is a stealth spell, cast without the verbal evocation and light show associated with most spells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","purchaseCost":20,"castCost":2,"type":"cantrip"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"6wNZheP2QwH8X7BL":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.l7Rdt5Oz2K0KzIoe"}},"_id":"M6jlnuBbSXy3djFo"}
